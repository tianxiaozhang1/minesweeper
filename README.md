# Minesweeper

Welcome to my Minesweeper exercise.

A game that needs no introduction - Minesweeper is a game originated in the 1960s and gained popularity since Windows 3.1. 

The rules of this particular version is similar to the Windows version; one minor difference being only flagging/sweeping all mines (and not opening any other squares) will win the game as well.

Gameplay looks like this:
