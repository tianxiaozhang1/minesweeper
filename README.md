# Minesweeper

Welcome to my Minesweeper exercise.

A game that needs no introduction - Minesweeper is a game from the 1960s and gained popularity since Windows 3.1 in 1992. The Microsoft version was created by Curt Johnson (for IBM's OS/2) and Robert Donner (for Windows).

The rules of this particular version is similar to the Windows version; one minor difference being only flagging/sweeping all mines (and not necessarily opening any other squares) will win the game as well. One added function is to guarantee a successful initial click so the game won't be over before it begins (game will replace the map if a mine is hit upon first click).

Only the "Expert" difficulty is implemented for simplicity.

In the updated version a self-solving feature is added.

## Requirements

### Python 3

## [New] Auto-Solving

Tired of all the clicking? The game can solve itself. Using the same info and logic as a human (but very very lucky when a guess is necessary).
