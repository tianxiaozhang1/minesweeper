# Minesweeper

Welcome to my Minesweeper exercise.

A game that needs no introduction - Minesweeper is a game from the 1960s and gained popularity since Windows 3.1 in 1992. The Microsoft version was created by Curt Johnson (for IBM's OS/2) and Robert Donner (for Windows).

The rules of this particular version is similar to the Windows version; one minor difference being only flagging/sweeping all mines (and not opening any other squares) will win the game as well.

Only the "Expert" difficulty is implemented for simplicity.

Gameplay looks like this:
